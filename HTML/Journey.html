            <h3>Undergrad Coursework</h3>
              <p> I received my bachelors in psychology at UNC Chapel Hill in 2018. While there, I learned about the importance of reserach, and the dominance of statistics in maintaining credibility
                in the field. So I tacked on a minor in statistics and analytics (which was called Mathematical Decision Sciences) at the time. We primarily learned the R programming language, and ultimately
                I was unable to keep up.</p>

              <p>It was a difficult first programming language, and it definitely hurt my overall gpa. I was planning to become
                a clinical psychologist though, so there was no issue there -- or so I thought. </p>

                <h3>First Steps & Self-Discovery</h3>
                <p>My first job out of undergrad was for a clinical psychology lab called HARP, the HIV and Addictions Research Program. 
                    Here I worked on an MRI study as a clinical research assistant, and I realized a few things:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I was not interested in the direction of my field - at least in terms of research</li>
                    <li>I wanted to find better working environments</li>
                    <li>I do not live to work</li>
                </ol>
                <p> That last bullet point came as the harsh reality of finding out my passions did not lie in the pursuit of work. I had built up the idea in my head that I would 
                    get my PhD in clinical psychology, and become a professor with my name in textbooks...</p>
                <p> But what I learned from HARP - outside of my career interests - was that I did not want to be someone who put my career above all else. I had hobbies that I enjoyed,
                    I had bills I needed to pay, I had aspirations on where I wanted to be in 10 years. Sacrificing those things for another 7-10 years of schooling in a highly selective field 
                    while being underpaid was not something I had enough passion for, nor the privilege to achieve.
                </p>
                <p> Then, Covid-19 hit, and I needed to find a new job.</p>

                <h3>Finding A New Career</h3>
                <p> I chose to join the <span>Behavior And Technology Lab</span> (also known as BATLab) for several reasons, but most importantly,
                    I felt like it would be a great place to learn about how technology can influence
                    people's health, especially during the turbulence of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
                <p>In this role I became acquanted with Mobile Health Apps that we developed to assist with medication adherence for individuals living with HIV or on Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV.
                    We did everything virtually during the pandemic and there were many adjustments with regards to how we would interact with peers and participants. At this time, I began to realize just how much
                    data we had, and how many various different information repositories we interacted with.</p>
                <p>I started to explore organizational methods, and tried to understand our database architectures with my limited skills, and started volunteering with an on-campus organization:
                    <a href="https://www.hgaps.org/">HGAPS</a> - a group that looks to disseminate high quality psychological materials with the public.</p>
                <div class="media-object">
                    <img class="media-image" src="../Images/hgaps_logo.png" alt="HGAPS Logo">
                </div>
                <p>That's when I decided that I needed to go back to school to learn more about how people interact with technology. I wanted to become well versed in the way in which
                    information is retrieved by the public, and how to improve the user experience in seeking out high-quality information.

            <h3>Passion & Work</h3>
            <p> Thus, I headed back to school to pursue a Master's degree in Information Science. And as I've continued to grow in my skills as a researcher, I've decided that I want
                to become more well versed in the skills of user-experience and accessibility research. I want to eventually be able to assist in improving the experience of finding data/information both
                for other researchers, and the general public. Providing access to those who need it, and eschewing obfuscation for those who are seeking the information. </p>
            <p> While I love the sphere of health research, I would love to bring my love for hobbies into my work as well. My dream job would be to work as a user accessibility
                researcher for the videogame industry. I would want to be able to utilize my skills in methodology to provide as much access to one of my favorite forms of entertainment for those
                who are disadvantaged. </p> 
            <p> In this program I've learned a bit of <span>python</span> and as evidenced here <span>HTML/CSS!</span> It's been very rewarding to learn how to interact with computers better, and 
                I want to be competent at these skills. Though, I don't have aspirations of becoming a computer programmer, I want to be conversational in these tools so that I can communicate with peers
                in a nuanced and technical way. In my experience, technically skilled employees: programmers, back-end/front-end developers, database administrators and so on are unfortunately given tasks
                from the standpoint of a project manager with no technical expertise. </p>
            <p> In my ideal role, I would be someone capable of <span>coordinating</span> teams from both research and developer mindsets. I would want to not only be able to conduct research on user experience, 
                but be able to properly <span>articulate actionable change</span> for the technical teams involved. </p>
