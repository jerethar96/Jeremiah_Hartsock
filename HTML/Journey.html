            <h3>Undergrad Coursework</h3>
              <p> I received my bachelors in psychology at UNC Chapel Hill in 2018. While there, I learned about the importance of reserach, and the dominance of statistics in maintaining credibility
                in the field. So I tacked on a minor in statistics and analytics (which was called Mathematical Decision Sciences) at the time. We primarily learned the R programming language, and ultimately
                I was unable to keep up.</p>

              <p>It was a difficult first programming language, and it definitely hurt my overall gpa. I was planning to become
                a clinical psychologist though, so there was no issue there -- or so I thought. </p>

                <h3>First Steps & Self-Discovery</h3>
                <p>My first job out of undergrad was for a clinical psychology lab called HARP, the HIV and Addictions Research Program. 
                    Here I worked on an MRI study as a clinical research assistant, and I realized a few things:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I was not interested in the direction of my field - at least in terms of research</li>
                    <li>I wanted to find better working environments</li>
                    <li>I do not live to work</li>
                </ol>
                <p> That last bullet point came as the harsh reality of finding out my passions did not lie in the pursuit of work. I had built up the idea in my head that I would 
                    get my PhD in clinical psychology, and become a professor with my name in textbooks...</p>
                <p> But what I learned from HARP - outside of my career interests - was that I did not want to be someone who put my career above all else. I had hobbies that I enjoyed,
                    I had bills I needed to pay, I had aspirations on where I wanted to be in 10 years. Sacrificing those things for another 7-10 years of schooling in a highly selective field 
                    where I was going to be paid scraps was not something I had the passion for, nor the privilege to achieve.
                </p>
                <p> Then, Covid-19 hit, and I needed to find a new job.</p>

                <p>I started my work with the <a href="https://batlab.web.unc.edu/jeremiah-hartsock/">BATLab</a> in June of 2020</p>

                <h3>Finding A New Career</h3>
                <p> I chose to join the Behavior And Technology Lab (also known as BATLab) for several reasons, but most importantly,
                    I felt like it would be a great place to learn about how technology can influence
                    people's health, especially during the turbulence of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
                <p>In this role I became acquanted with Mobile Health Apps that we developed to assist with medication adherence for individuals living with HIV or on Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV.
                    We did everything virtually during the pandemic and there were many adjustments with regards to how we would interact with peers and participants. At this time, I began to realize just how much
                    data we had lying around in our folders, and how many various different information repositories we interacted with.
                </p>
                <p>I started to explore organizational methods, and tried to understand our database architectures with my limited skills.</p>

            <h3>Passion & Work</h3>
            <p> My interest in pursuing a Master's degree in Information Science started thanks to the work on those mobile apps. And as I've continued to grow in my skills as a researcher, I've decided that I want
                to become more well versed in the skills of user-experience and accessibility research. The greatest hope would be to work eventually in the videogame industry, or an adjacent tech entertainment industry.
                That way I can work on things I love to do outside of work, and I could work towards making sure that everyone - no matter their background or abilities, could enjoy those hobbies.
