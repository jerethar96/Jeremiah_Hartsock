               <h2>The Purpose</h2>
               <p>This study works towards improving the available evidence-based psychological resources 
                  to the public. It seeks to provide a repository of credible/useful information that is not 
                  advertised content.

            <li>
               <h2>Methods</h2>
               <p> Two methods used were volunteer sampling of mental health professionals providing resources
                  followed by a systematic review of the accumulated materials.

               <p>This study provides navigation for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) care in Rural North Carolina counties.
                  Clinics from across the State are randomized to either receive or not receive access to a PrEP Navigator - who will assist
                  young people with finding access to care; however, both randomized arms will include access to a mobile 
                  application designed to help young people on PrEP stay current on their sexual health care.

                     In my rendition of the application, I worked on <span>HMP Stigma</span> which was designed to provide
                     a safe space for young men who have sex with men and transgender women to discuss sexual health and 
                     connect with people, hopefully to improve HIV care outcomes.

                     This is a clinical trial of a mobile application with randomized parallel assignment.
                     There were three arms in the study.

                     <li>Arm 3: participants enrolled in Arm 2 have the option to enroll peers onto the app</li>

               <li>
                  <h2>Implementation</h2>
                  <p>In this study I developed better systems of information retrieval by organizing team meetings 
                     between select staff and our industry partner who developed the HMP website and database.
                  </p> 
                  <p> I also monitored forum activity on the app to ensure participants were engaged with the material.</p>
