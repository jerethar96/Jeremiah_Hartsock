        <p style = "font-size:70%;">Jeremiah Hartsock is a research professional passionate about dissemination and resource accessibility. 
         He started working in research shortly after his Freshman year of Undergraduate studies at
         University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and is continuing his education by pursuing his Masters in Information Science.
         His goal is to serve as an <span>systems architect and information coordinator</span> - an individual who helps clinicians and researchers
         interpret available information and communicate effective systems analyses and information needs across industry partners
         and stakeholders. In his free time he enjoys listening to and exploring music music, playing tabletop games surrounded by friendly folx, and a nice 
         cup of pour-over coffee.</p>

               <h3>LoFi Beats</h3>
               <p style ="font-size: x-small;"> I learned that you can generate a lofi character from the LoFi Beats to Study and Relax To and that there's merchandise and you can purchase 
                  and can access their links to the playlists on their <a href="https://lofigirl.com/"> website</a></p>
            </div>
         </div>
         <p style ="font-size: 80%;">I've been listening to a ton of LoFi music while working on my website. So far, I've been able to develop this home page with links to a few of my social medias and my current resume, but
         eventually I'm hoping to be able to add more <span>"blog-like"</span> components and/or links to more direct work that would help me showcase my abilities. I also admit that I had a lot of help from the w3schools template on
         "how to build a website," but through using that resource, I've learned more about html structures. 
         </p>
         <p style ="font-size: 80%;">The good news is that I'm becoming more confident with how to use resources like w3schools and even though I'm relying a bit heavily on the  "div" tag, I'm able to understand more about inheritance
         and how it affects my project. For example, the header background and navbar each use opacity, which affects the text that I put inside them as well. Over time, I hope to change that and make it so my text
         pops out a bit more from the background itself. 
         </p>
         <p style ="font-size: 80%;"> In fact, I've been looking at different websites and trying to take a look at how they're designed a bit more purposefully. I'm not sure I'll every want to 
         do something as overtly stylized as this <a href="https://www.aronmayo.com/"> example page</a> on SquareSpace. That said, I tend to spend a lot of my free time thinking about hobbies, which involves
         looking at community driven websites, and a style that I really appreciate is at this <a href="https://ageofminiatures.com/hunter-clade-kill-team-guide/">blog</a>

               <h3>Hobby Page</h3>
               <p style ="font-size: x-small;"> This example homepage is sleek and contains about the level of complexity I would want from my personal portfolio. It may be a bit link heavy, but I really appreciate 
               the styling for each of the articles like the ones linked above.</p>
